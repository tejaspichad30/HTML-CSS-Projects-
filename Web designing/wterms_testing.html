<b>Testing Terms:</b>

1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or functions of a codebase (e.g., testing a single function in JavaScript) to ensure
   they work as intended. Common frameworks include Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine.
        
2. Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between different components or modules to ensure they work together correctly. Tools 
   like Cypress or Selenium are often used for this.
        
3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Simulates a complete user journey to verify that all components of the application work together as 
   expected from start to finish. Cypress, Playwright, and Selenium are popular tools for E2E testing.
        
4. Regression Testing: Testing existing functionality after changes (like new features or bug fixes) to ensure nothing has been broken 
   in the process. Automated tests are commonly used here to save time.
        
5. Cross-Browser Testing: Verifying that a website functions correctly across different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and 
   browser versions. Tools like BrowserStack and LambdaTest are used to automate this process.
        
6. Performance Testing: Evaluating the speed, responsiveness, and stability of a website under various conditions. Techniques include:
    - Load Testing: Simulating many users accessing the site at once to check how it performs under high traffic.
    - Stress Testing: Testing the website beyond its normal operational capacity to see where it breaks.
    - Speed Testing: Measuring page load times and optimizing for better performance. Tools include Google Lighthouse, GTmetrix, and 
      WebPageTest.
        
7. Accessibility Testing: Ensuring that the website is usable by people with disabilities, following guidelines such as WCAG (Web 
   Content Accessibility Guidelines). Tools include Axe, Wave, and Lighthouse.
        
8. Usability Testing: Involves observing real users as they interact with the site to identify usability issues and ensure a smooth 
   user experience.
        
9. Security Testing: Identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring that the website is protected against threats like SQL injection, XSS 
   (Cross-Site Scripting), and data breaches. Tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite are commonly used.
        
10. A/B Testing: Comparing two versions of a webpage (version A and B) to determine which performs better in terms of user engagement 
    or conversion rates. Platforms like Google Optimize and Optimizely are often used.
        
11. Smoke Testing: A preliminary test to check if the basic functions of an application work correctly after a new build. This is often 
    the first line of testing after deployment.
        
12. Sanity Testing: A quick check after receiving a new build to ensure that specific functionalities or bug fixes work as intended 
    without going deep into details.
        
13. Exploratory Testing: An informal testing process where testers explore the application without predefined test cases to identify 
    unexpected behavior or bugs.
        
14. Validation Testing: Ensures that the software meets the business requirements and specifications laid out at the start of the 
    project.
        
15. Mock Testing: Using mock data or fake services to test parts of an application that depend on external services or databases, 
    ensuring those dependencies do not slow down testing.
        
16. Responsive Testing: Testing how the website adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions to ensure it works well on desktops, 
    tablets, and mobile devices.
        
17. API Testing: Testing APIs directly to validate their functionality, reliability, performance, and security. Tools like Postman, 
    SoapUI, and Insomnia are commonly used.
