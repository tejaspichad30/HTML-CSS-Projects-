1. Frontend vs. Backend :
Frontend: Refers to everything the user interacts with directly in the browserâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the basis of frontend 
development.

implemented in languages like Python, Java, PHP, or Node.js.

headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

3. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) :
A stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML content, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness. CSS 
allows for the separation of content and design, enhancing the user experience.

communicate and share data, essential for integrating third-party services like payment gateways, social media, and more.

HTTP is the protocol used for transmitting data over the web. HTTPS adds a layer of security through encryption, ensuring that the data 
exchanged between the server and client is secure, which is crucial for protecting sensitive information.
