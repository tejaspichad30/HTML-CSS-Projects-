# HTML-CSS-Projects-
HTML and CSS projects focus on building visually appealing and functional websites. HTML structures the content (e.g., text, images, forms), while CSS styles it (e.g., colors, layouts, animations). Examples include portfolio sites, e-commerce platforms, blogs, and landing pages, showcasing creativity and technical skills in web design.
